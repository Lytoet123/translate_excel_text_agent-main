ASSESSMENT:
1. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, poorly controlled (HbA1c 8.4%)
2. Hypertension, uncontrolled (BP 158/92 mmHg)
3. Hyperlipidemia
4. Early Diabetic Nephropathy (microalbuminuria)
5. Overweight (BMI 29.7 kg/m²)

TREATMENT PLAN:

1. Diabetes Management:
   - Adjust Metformin to 1000 mg TID
   - Add SGLT-2 inhibitor: Empagliflozin 10 mg QD
   - Consider GLP-1 receptor agonist if glycemic targets not achieved within 3 months
   - Blood glucose self-monitoring: twice daily (fasting and 2 hours post-prandial)
   - HbA1c target: <7.0%

2. Hypertension Management:
   - Increase Lisinopril to 20 mg QD
   - Add Amlodipine 5 mg QD
   - Home blood pressure monitoring: twice daily
   - BP target: <130/80 mmHg

3. Hyperlipidemia Management:
   - Continue Atorvastatin 20 mg QD
   - Target LDL: <2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL)

4. Nephroprotection:
   - Continue ACE inhibitor (Lisinopril)
   - Monitor renal function and UACR every 3 months

5. Lifestyle Modifications:
   - Dietary recommendations:
     * Caloric restriction (1500 kcal/day)
     * Low sodium diet (<2.3 g/day)
     * Reduced carbohydrate intake (45-50% of total calories)
     * Increase dietary fiber (25-30 g/day)
   - Physical activity:
     * Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise for 150 minutes per week
     * Resistance training twice weekly
   - Weight loss goal: 5-7% of body weight over 6 months (4-5 kg)
   - Complete smoking cessation
   - Limit alcohol consumption to ≤1 drink per day

6. Patient Education:
   - Diabetes self-management education
   - Proper foot care
   - Recognition of hypoglycemia symptoms and management
   - Importance of medication adherence

7. Preventive Care:
   - Annual dilated eye examination
   - Comprehensive foot examination every 6 months
   - Annual influenza vaccination
   - Pneumococcal vaccination as per age-appropriate guidelines

FOLLOW-UP:
- Return to clinic in 4 weeks for assessment of response to therapy
- Laboratory tests (FPG, electrolytes, renal function) in 2 weeks
- HbA1c reassessment in 3 months

PROGNOSIS:
With adherence to the treatment plan, including medication adjustments, lifestyle modifications, and regular follow-up, the patient has a good prognosis for improved glycemic control, blood pressure management, and prevention of diabetes-related complications.

DISCUSSION:
This case demonstrates the complexity of managing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with comorbid hypertension. The patient presents with suboptimal control of both conditions despite current therapy, necessitating a multifaceted approach. The addition of an SGLT-2 inhibitor provides both glycemic control and potential cardiorenal protection, which is particularly important given the patient's early diabetic nephropathy. The treatment plan aligns with current clinical guidelines that recommend a patient-centered approach with consideration of comorbidities when selecting antihyperglycemic agents. Simultaneous management of hypertension is crucial, as blood pressure control significantly reduces the risk of both macro- and microvascular complications in patients with diabetes. Regular monitoring and follow-up will allow for timely adjustments to therapy to achieve target goals and prevent disease progression.
